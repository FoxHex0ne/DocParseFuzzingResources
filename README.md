# DocParseFuzzingResources
This repository will be containing all kind of additional resources that I think might be useful for someone fuzzing document (pdf, doc, xls...) parsers.

Resources:
/Urls - Contain csv files with lot of urls to specific filetype inputs (pdf.csv file contains urls to pdf-s, etc). Values represented for each input are: HASH, SIZE, URL and each csv file contains 500 000 entries.



NB: Yes, Github is not good place to keep this kind of data (large files, etc.). I will move this soon.
